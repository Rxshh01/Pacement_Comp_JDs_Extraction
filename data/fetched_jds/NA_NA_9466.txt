You will be responsible for performing fundamental new research, transferring technology to product groups, and draft patent applications.
Summary
You will push the boundaries of the state-of-the-art in audio and media technologies. The ideal candidate would have a strong background in deep learning, both in terms of conceptual understanding, as well as practical experience. A core aspect of this role involves being able to keep up to date with the literature, implement, and innovate with the bleeding edge in generative models, self-supervised learning, and multi-modal learning.
With the explosion of large language models and natural language processing, you will partner closely with Dolby’s worldwide AI research staff, which actively pursues the integration of such models into audio and media experiences. You will be able to hit the ground running, innovate, and contribute to such projects. Consequently, experience with language models, question answering, vision-language models, captioning, etc. would be highly beneficial.
Consequently, knowledge or experience in any/all of the following are helpful:
Diffusion, autoregressive, or other generative models.
Natural Language Processing, LLMs.
Self-supervised, contrastive learning, auto-encoders.
Audio, image, or text applications – Source separation, text-to-speech, music synthesis, image segmentation, image captioning, question answering, language models, etc.
Main responsibilities
