Job Details
"Join EDGE as a DSP Engineer and be part of an innovative team shaping the future of radio and satellite communications, where you'll drive complex signal processing solutions and pioneer advancements in Software Defined Radio across cutting-edge platforms."
Job
Purpose:
DSP
Engineers will be included in a design team that develops complex signal
processing systems in various application areas, but essentially for
radio and satellite communications.
The
candidate will be involved in all technology and product development stages, including definition, analysis, computational modelling, prototype design,
laboratory testing, process development, and manufacturing.
The
candidate will participate in the development of a Software Design Radio that will be implemented using a variety of platforms, including embedded DSP, FPGA, and dedicated High-Level Software Applications.
The
candidate will contribute to and lead this ambitious project, working
collaboratively in multi-disciplinary teams with a high degree of devolved
responsibility.
We
are looking for someone who enjoys forward-thinking technologies and needs to apply complex problem-solving techniques to maximize the potential of new
systems.
Key
Activities:
Broad
knowledge of radio communications theory, with particular expertise in radio
transceiver concepts, digital modulation techniques, channel estimation,
equalization and MIMO.
Experience
