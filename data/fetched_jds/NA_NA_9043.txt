[Responsibilities]
Sumitomo
Heavy Industries is leveraging its extensive experience in fabricating large
steel structures to automate the manufacturing, maintenance, and dismantling
processes throughout their lifecycle. These tasks often involve high-altitude
or confined-space work, and our automation efforts aim to enhance worker safety
while maintaining or improving productivity, even amidst labor shortages. By
applying robotics to the maintenance of critical infrastructure, such as
petrochemical plants, power facilities, and ships, we contribute to the
development of a sustainable society. Our proprietary wall-climbing robot
technology is now advancing toward practical application as part of a new
business development initiative. This is an exciting project with a strong focus
on commercialization, and we are seeking a Robotics Engineer to join our team
to help bring these cutting-edge robotics solutions to the market.
