Job Summary: (PWR PAS for NCG’s
We are seeking highly motivated and talented New College Graduates to join our R&D team in Bengaluru to be a part
of the 2.7B$ Power Business Unit. As a global leader, Renesas shipped >4 Billion ICs last year powering the next
generation of Automotive, Industrial and Consumer Applications. With company level growth projections of a 1000
people in India by end of 2025, we are heavily investing in Bengaluru, making the site a critical hub for expanding
Power R&D footprint.
As a key contributor, you will work on designing, simulating, and validating circuits that meet specific technical
requirements. You will collaborate with senior engineers and cross-functional teams to bring innovative electronic
solutions from concept to production.
Key Responsibilities:
 Circuit Design: Design and develop Analog and/or Digital circuits for various applications, including
consumer electronics, automotive systems, or industrial devices.
 HDL Coding: Develop and verify hardware designs using Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) such as
VHDL or Verilog. Ensure that designs meet performance, power, and area requirements.
 RTL Simulation and Verification: Perform simulations at different levels of abstraction (e.g., RTL, gatelevel)
to verify design correctness and adherence to specifications. Utilize testbenches and other
verification techniques to ensure robust designs.
 Circuit Simulation and Analysis: Perform circuit simulations using industry-standard tools (e.g., SPICE,
Cadence, etc.) to ensure designs meet performance and reliability criteria.
Problem Solving: Troubleshoot and resolve design-related issues, making adjustments as necessary to
meet project goals and timelines.
 Continuous Learning: Stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and industry trends to incorporate new
ideas and techniques into your work.
Qualifications:
 Education: Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering, Electronics Engineering, or a related
field.
 Knowledge: Strong understanding of analog and digital circuit design principles, semiconductor device
physics, IC fabrication processes, and layout design principles. Familiarity with microcontrollers, FPGAs,
and other embedded systems is a plus.
 Skills: Proficiency in circuit simulation tools (e.g., SPICE, Cadence), HDL coding (VDHL, Verilog) and EDA
tools for layout design (e.g., Cadence Virtuoso, Synopsys IC Compiler). Experience with PCB layout tools
(e.g., Altium, Eagle) is desirable. Basic programming skills (e.g., Python, C/C++) are beneficial.
 Automation: Develop scripts and automated flows to improve the efficiency of the verification process.
Utilize tools such as Perl, Python, or Tcl for scripting tasks.
 Experience: Relevant coursework, internships, or projects in circuit design. Hands-on experience with
laboratory equipment such as oscilloscopes, multimeters, and soldering tools.
 Communication: Excellent verbal and written communication skills. Ability to work well in a team-oriented
environment.
 Attitude: A proactive, detail-oriented, and results-driven mindset. Eagerness to learn and adapt to new
challenges.
Benefits:
 Competitive salary and benefits package.
 Opportunities for professional development and career advancement.
 Collaborative and innovative work environment.
