About Lyric
Here at Lyric, weâ€™re building the future of Supply Chain AI, with the team best equipped to build it. Traditional supply chain software, often supplemented with ad hoc analysis, is too rigid for modern AI capabilities. Custom AI solutions are time-consuming, costly to develop in-house, and lack proper supply chain context. These issues make it hard for large supply chain organizations to fully leverage advanced data & decision science.
Our platform, the "Lyric Studio", accelerates your ability to create and consume advanced supply chain models (e.g. stockout prediction & network optimization). A catalog of ready-to-use algorithms and optimization models makes it easy for business users to create sophisticated no-code applications. Lyric Studio also enables technical users to train prediction models & deploy custom algorithms to a private catalog for future reuse. Lyric allows for faster, more advanced supply chain decisions of all shapes and sizes, which is why dozens of Fortune 500 enterprises are saving millions with Lyric today.
Key Responsibilities:
Develop, implement, and maintain time series models to forecast demand, inventory levels, and other key supply chain metrics.
Identify and analyze anomalies in time series data to detect potential issues in the supply chain processes.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to understand business requirements and translate them into data-driven solutions.
Design and conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of different models and approaches.
Communicate findings and insights to both technical and non-technical stakeholders through reports, dashboards, and presentations.
Stay current with the latest advancements in time series methods and technologies, and incorporate them into the team's workflow.
Qualifications:
Proficiency in programming languages such as Python or R.
Knowledge of time series forecasting techniques (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM).
Strong understanding of statistical methods and machine learning algorithms.
Familiarity with data visualization tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI, matplotlib, seaborn).
Familiarity with supply chain processes and challenges is highly desirable.
Excellent problem-solving skills and the ability to think critically and analytically.
Strong communication skills and the ability to work collaboratively in a team environment.
Preferred Qualifications:
Familiarity with big data technologies (e.g., Hadoop, Spark).
Knowledge of optimization techniques and tools (e.g., linear programming, mixed-integer programming).
Familiarity with cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).
