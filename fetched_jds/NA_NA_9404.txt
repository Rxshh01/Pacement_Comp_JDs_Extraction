Job Details
We are seeking a
Design Implementation Engineer
with experience to own the backend implementation of RISC-V cores and uncore blocks. The ideal candidate will be responsible for owning the Backend Convergence from synthesis to timing closure, and will work closely with RTL designers to ensure design closure.
Key Responsibilities:
Backend Implementation of RISC-V Cores and Uncore Blocks:
Implement the design through Synthesis, Place and Route, and Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS).
UPF-based low-power design implementation.
Scan insertion and timing closure to meet design requirements.
Collaborate closely with RTL designers to address design gaps and ensure convergence.
Analyze and resolve CDC, LINT, and Formality issues.
Design Understanding and Backend Convergence:
Develop a strong understanding of the design micro-architecture.
Approach backend convergence with a focus on performance, power, and area (PPA) optimization.
Minimum Qualifications:
Bachelor/Masters degree in Electrical or Computer Engineering
Experience in backend design implementation, including synthesis, place and route, and CTS.
Proficiency in UPF-based low-power design techniques.
Familiarity with scan insertion, timing closure, and validation methods such as CDC, LINT, and Formality.
Preferred Qualifications:
Strong collaboration skills to work with RTL designers and cross-functional teams.
Understanding of microarchitecture and its influence on backend design convergence.
Experience with low-power design methodologies.
