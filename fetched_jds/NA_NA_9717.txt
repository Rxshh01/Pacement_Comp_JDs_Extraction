About Ola:
For over a decade, Ola has revolutionized personal mobility by making it seamless and accessible. Today Ola is amongst the world’s leading mobility companies serving 250 million customers across 3 continents.
Our electric vehicles business is the next step in our mission to move the world to sustainable mobility. We believe that India with its unique skill sets, manpower, and demography, should not just lead the global movement towards electric vehicles but be the driving force that creates this change.
To accelerate this, we’re investing nearly Rs 2,400 crores to build the world’s largest two-wheeler factory near Krishnagiri, Tamil Nadu. The factory will have the capacity to manufacture over 5M electric two-wheelers a year and will create over 10,000 jobs. A testament to Indian manufacturing and the ‘Make in India’ mission, this factory will be our global hub from which serve not just our home market in India but also export to our key markets across Europe, UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Latin America. This is the first of our factories and will be used to make our range of electric scooters and other electric two-wheelers. Over time, we aim to manufacture a range of electric vehicles across 2 and 4 wheeler categories.
In addition to the factory itself, we are also investing heavily into developing local IP across the core technologies including batteries and electric motors, which will help our country become AatmaNirbhar on these critical aspects of the EV value chain and catalyze an indigenous supply chain for them.
With a sleek and seamless design, strong engineering capabilities, and Indian manufacturing talent, it is no wonder that our electric scooter has already won several prestigious global design and innovation awards including the IHS Markit Innovation award at CES and the German Design Award.
We remain committed to the Prime Minister’s vision of clean mobility powered by clean energy and will continue to innovate to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable mobility.
