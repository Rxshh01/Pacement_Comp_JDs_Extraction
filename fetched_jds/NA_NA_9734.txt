About Lyric
Here at Lyric, weâ€™re building the future of Supply Chain AI, with the team best equipped to build it. Traditional supply chain software, often supplemented with ad hoc analysis, is too rigid for modern AI capabilities. Custom AI solutions are time-consuming, costly to develop in-house, and lack proper supply chain context. These issues make it hard for large supply chain organizations to fully leverage advanced data & decision science.
Our platform, the "Lyric Studio", accelerates your ability to create and consume advanced supply chain models (e.g. stockout prediction & network optimization). A catalog of ready-to-use algorithms and optimization models makes it easy for business users to create sophisticated no-code applications. Lyric Studio also enables technical users to train prediction models & deploy custom algorithms to a private catalog for future reuse. Lyric allows for faster, more advanced supply chain decisions of all shapes and sizes, which is why dozens of Fortune 500 enterprises are saving millions with Lyric today.
