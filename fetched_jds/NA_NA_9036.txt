Position Summary
】
We, the XR System Technology Development Department, are
a division of the Technology Development Laboratories located in Tokyo, Japan.
Our mission is to spearhead the development of XR (Extended Reality) core
technologies and pave the way for launching new XR business ventures.
At our department, we focus on three key areas that serve as the foundation for
XR technology advancements:
a) Developing System Technology for Downsizing and Lightening HMDs and
Naked-Eye 3D Displays:
We are dedicated to pushing the boundaries of XR hardware by developing
cutting-edge system technologies that enable the downsizing and lightening of
Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) and naked-eye 3D displays. Our goal is to enhance
user comfort and mobility while delivering immersive XR experiences.
b) Developing Sensing/Rendering/Simulation Technologies for Seamlessly
Presenting Mixed-Reality Worlds:
Creating seamless mixed-reality experiences is a critical aspect of XR
technology. To achieve this, we focus on the development of advanced sensing,
rendering, and simulation technologies. By leveraging state-of-the-art
techniques, we aim to bridge the gap between the physical and virtual worlds,
ensuring a smooth and natural integration of the two.
c) Developing XR (AR/VR) Content Creation Technology Assisted by AI:
The creation of compelling XR content is crucial for captivating user
experiences. To achieve this, we harness the power of AI technology in the
development of XR content creation tools. By leveraging AI algorithms, we
empower creators to generate immersive and interactive XR content, pushing the
boundaries of creativity and engagement.
As an XR System Engineer, you will play a crucial role in advancing the field
of human-computer interaction by contributing to the development of XR core
technologies. This position requires a comprehensive engineering skill set,
encompassing both hardware and software domains. On the hardware side, you will
work on mechanical, electronic, and optical designs. On the software side, your
expertise will span across various areas, including computer vision, real-time
3D graphics, physics and motion planning used in game engines, parallel
algorithms applicable to GPU or FPGA, video/audio codecs, real-time operating
systems, wired and wireless networking, machine learning, and more.
Your expertise in a specific technology area, coupled with your curiosity for
various related technologies, will be essential in driving our innovation
forward. We encourage you to propose and develop new research themes that
combine your expertise with Sony's unique hardware, such as CMOS image sensors.
-Working environment:
Main offices of Sony Corporation are located at Shinagawa, Osaki and
Minatomirai in Japan.
Although the offices are in Japan, you can work in an English-speaking
environment, and you can also take Japanese lessons if needed.
Join us in shaping the future of XR technology and redefining the way we
interact with computers. Together, we can push the boundaries of what is
possible in the world of XR. If you are passionate about XR technology, have a
strong engineering background, and thrive in a collaborative and innovative
environment, we invite you to apply for this exciting opportunity as an XR
System Engineer.
