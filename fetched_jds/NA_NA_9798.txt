Job Details
The AI &
Computational Sciences (AICS)
is the dedicated AI team at Novartis Biomedical Research (BR)
whose mission is to apply AI to accelerate discoveries of transformative
medicines for patients worldwide.
AICS is seeking a highly motivated junior
level AI engineers and researchers to help us in the transformation. At AICS,
you will take on a hands-on a role at the intersection of AI, computer science,
and biological and chemical sciences using extensive internal and external data
for realistic applications. You will have the opportunity to be a part of the
next wave of disease understanding and drug discovery, combining insights from
a wealth of data modalities including diverse omics types like genomics,
transcriptomics (such as single-cell RNA sequence data), proteomics, compound
structures, compound activity, protein structures, measurements from cellular
experiments and safety studies, histopathology, clinical imaging, and clinical
readouts. You will be a part of a unique organization made up of accomplished
scientists who are at the forefront of various AI disciplines and will benefit
from on-the-job learning where there are gaps. We are primarily hiring three
focus areas: NLP and Generative AI, Image processing, and application of AI to
design of biologics.
Your Responsibilities:
-
Hands-on role developing and implementing
innovative AI methods (use of an AI model on a specific dataset for a specific
purpose) under supervision as well as independently to deliver on highly
visible projects
-
Advanced development skills in Python and the
ability to understand and internalizing AI models from published papers and
repositories
-
Train, test, and evaluate AI models on realistic
internal and external data, and present results in an organized manner for team
evaluation and input
-
Develop and deliver various biological and
chemical insights and outcomes from applying AI models for broader
communication
-
Stay up to date in the latest developments of
the AI methodology and novel evolving AI methods through self-learning and
using on-the-job opportunities
-
Understand and manage run time requirements of
AI models, visualizations, and cloud-based computation to increase efficiency and
quality of AI approaches
-
Develop new AI models from scratch using
TensorFlow or PyTorch, understanding and modifying learning objectives and
training methods of the models
What you will bring to the role:
-
Extensive classroom learning as well as
on-the-job, hands-on experience of advanced AI models, selecting and applying suitable
AI models for a given purpose.
-
Experience with AI is expected not just at the
level of running the code but deep understanding models, their purpose, and the
ability to interpret functioning of a model on given data
-
Demonstrable deep experience in one or more of
specific AI focus areas we are hiring: NLP and Generative Models (LLMs), Image
Processing, and/or application to Biologics design, as related to problems and
data in life sciences and drug discovery
-
Strong skills in Python, relevant Deep Learning
frameworks such Transformers, advanced AI model training methods
-
Experience with high performance computing
systems and cloud-based services involving large and diverse biomedical data
-
Running AI model using GPU is a must and the
ability to scale a model to multi-GPUs is big plus
-
Strong communication skills to explain technical
details, decisions, consequences, and results to senior researchers and non-data
science communities
-
Deep understanding of biological and chemical datasets,
knowledge repositories in the areas such Gene Ontology
-
A humble and curious mind that can continuously
learn while recognizing and applying internal resources to the overall vision
and purpose of the team
Minimum Requirements:
-
Bachelor’s degree (master’s or PhD is desirable)
in a computational field including, but not limited to: Computer Science,
Applied Mathematics, Computational Biology/Chemistry, Engineering, Statistics, and
Physics
-
1 - 3 years of deep, hands-on experience working
on AI projects and either clear evidence of significant projects personally
developed and delivered and/or publication track record
-
1 - 3 years of experience in working with large
scale, realistic data sets and analyzing results towards specific
business/scientific outcomes
-
Experience in pharma, biotech, or healthcare is a
big plus but strong tech background with the willingness to adapt to pharma
