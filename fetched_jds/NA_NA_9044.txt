Job Details
[Responsibilities]
・
Research
and development (R&D) of detection and measurement systems for industrial robots or
industrial machinery.
・
Work
on the R&D of algorithms for image/point cloud measurement
systems used in rubber tired gantry cranes for container terminals, which
includes actual machine testing under the guidance of a mentor employee.
Throughout this experience, you will become proficient in our company's
R&D
processes and acquire skills in solving real-world
problems using applied optics.
・
After
finishing the project above, new application areas of the project, which you
will propose, may include optical measurement technology and process control
for industrial machinery for semiconductor industry, anomaly detection systems
using hyperspectral cameras or advanced camera systems, factory safety
management systems using RF (radio wave) or THz measurement, and product/part
inspection systems using laser measurement. You will also be expected to lead
the creation of new products/businesses and the improvement of existing ones,
leveraging the outcome of the R&D project.
[Required
Qualifications]
・
Completed
(or be expected to complete) the Ph.D program or have equivalent achievements.
Specialization in optics or related research topics is desirable.
・
Willingness
to pursue
R&D
for any of our diverse product lines, rather
than sticking to a single specific product.
・
Have
published at least two peer-reviewed papers as a first author. (Acceptance from
journals is also included. Peer-reviewed international conference proceedings
equivalent to journal papers are also acceptable, depending on your research
field).
・
At
least three years of experience in implementing programs, from acquisition to
analysis of experimental data, by yourself
・
Experience
in designing and adjusting optical systems by yourself, including practical
training in class, and should have learned how to handle optical instruments,
which includes lasers, lenses, mirrors and so on.
[Preferred
qualifications]
・
Experience
in leading and accomplishing your own research topic and/or individual (team)
project.
・
Experience
using optical simulation software such as Zemax/Code V or experience
implementing image/point cloud processing programs.
・
Experience
using ROS/ROS2
・
Experience
using Raspberry Pi or similar devices in your own research is desirable, as
well as taking a course of mechanical engineering, control engineering, or
electrical engineering as minor.
・
Experience
in creating 3D CAD models using software such as SolidWorks is desirable.
Experience with Unity or Blender is a plus.
[Career
Path]
・
In
the first to third year, you will acquire practical experience and knowledge
through on-the-job training (OJT) under the guidance of a mentor employee.
・
From
the third to fifth year, you will be expected to proactively conceive R&D
projects for our products and experience in completing these projects as a
person in charge of practical work.
・
In
the fifth to eighth year, you will be expected to take on the role of a leader
for a specific
R&D
project, including responsibility for
budget and progress management.
・
Following
the path above, you will be able to experience a series of R&D steps up to
the commercialization of the product based on the seed technology you will have
developed, which definitely will make your career fruitful both as a researcher
and as an engineer.
